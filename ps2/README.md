## rush - A barely functional, terrible, and error-prone shell in Rust

This is some seriously bad code but I'm going to continue hacking away at this project to gain a better understanding of how Rust works. Particularly egregious is the program_exec
function. I'm SURE there's a better way to do this and I would LOVE to hear comments tearing apart my code and telling me how to do it correctly!

There are a multitude of things that crash this program. It would probably be more useful to document what doesn't crash it right now.

This is an implementation of PS2; see the root readme for more.
